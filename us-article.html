      <h2>Why the US Can't Mind Its Own Business</h2>
      <p><em>By Purnima Choudhary | October 25, 2025</em></p>

      <p>From wars to policies, the US always seems to interrupt in everything. Whenever something major happens, the US is involved in almost everything.</p>

      <p>After World War II, the US became a global superpower and took it upon itself to manage world affairs. It became an unofficial global police force. Most of the time, the US wants to protect its own interests — like oil, trade, influence, or power.</p>

      <p>The US says it wants to support democracy and human rights, but it often acts in ways that primarily benefit itself. It has supported dictators and ignored major crises in some places. It has backed NATO allies like Japan and Israel while maintaining military bases in dozens of countries. With a massive army and vast financial resources, it can act fast — and often does, even when no one asks.</p>

      <p>Some people see the US as a global leader, while others think it needs to mind its own business. Whether helpful or harmful, one thing is clear: the US rarely stays out of global matters.</p>
